# Responsive Portfolio- My Portfolio

A portfolio template that is responsive to multiple size displays.

## Objectives
Create a portfolio that is responsive to different screen sizes.
Deploy portfolio template page with github pages.

I have used the collapsible navigation bar so it will hide the navugation links on the smaller screens and replace them with a button that should reveal them when the user will click on the button.

In order to create a brand or logo with the help of the Navbar :The .navbar-brand class is used to highlight the brand/or logo name of your page
